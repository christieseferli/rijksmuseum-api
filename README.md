# Background information
This assignment will assess your technical skills as a test engineer. You are free to choose any approach and tooling that you like to create a small test set against the public version of the Rijksmuseum API.
You can find the documentation on: https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api

## Assignment 2a
Define some tests that you would like to perform. Make sure you cover at least the basics to retrieve collections and retrieve details of objects within those collections. It might be that you find some unexpected behavior. If you do, please describe it.
## Assignment 2b
Run the tests in a CI environment of choice, building a simple pipeline. Provide a report or dashboard showing the results of the last runs.
